                Unless specified otherwise, all events are taking place at the Pearkes Event Centre. Schedule subject to change.
                There are no specific rules regarding wear - we recommend dressing semi-formally for Saturday and every day clothes for the rest.
                Know that we will try to spend as much time outside as possible, but that we also have access to a big indoor room, should weather deteriorate.
